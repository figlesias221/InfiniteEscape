# InfiniteEscape

A fast-paced endless runner game built with Unity as part of a Video Game 101 course.

## About

InfiniteEscape is an endless arcade-style game where players must navigate through an infinite stream of obstacles. Test your reflexes as the game progressively speeds up, challenging you to survive as long as possible while achieving high scores.

## Gameplay
